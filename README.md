# Job Market Data Cleaning & Visualization Project

This project was developed as part of the **WTM â€“ Data & Tech in Action** sessions under the supervision of **Eng. Mawada R. Elkholy**. The goal was to analyze and visualize job market data using Python and Power BI, focusing on data cleaning, transformation, and dashboard creation.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

The notebook `Cleaning.ipynb` walks through the entire process of:

- Loading and exploring the dataset
- Cleaning and preprocessing job listings data
- Removing irrelevant values and duplicates
- Extracting and transforming columns like `skills`, `job title`, and `salary`
- Creating new meaningful features
- Preparing the dataset for visualization in Power BI

After preprocessing, the cleaned dataset was used to build an interactive one-page dashboard in **Power BI**, highlighting key job market insights such as job titles, work type distributions, experience requirements, and more.
